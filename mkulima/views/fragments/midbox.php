<div class="col-lg-5">
    <h2>View Fragments</h2>

    <p>Essentially identical to layout fragments, these are found in views/fragments, or wherever you
        define the view fragments folder should be. It can be changed in constants.php, under config.</p>
<p>I will also render the title :) Title: {{title}}</p>
    <p><a class="btn" href="#">View details &raquo;</a></p>
</div>
